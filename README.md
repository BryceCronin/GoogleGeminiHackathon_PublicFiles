# Wordcraft
A Gemini-powered word game created for the 2024 Google AI Hackathon.

Contained in this repo are the python scripts that generate word combinations using the Gemini AI API, as well as the Windows .exe and Android .apk files.

To run the Python scripts, you must include your own API key.

I plan to further develop and publish this game after the conclusion of the hackathon.

For the judges of the Google AI Hackathon - you've also been added to a private repo that contains source code. Get in contact if you have any issues :)
